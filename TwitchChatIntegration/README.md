# Twitch Chat Integration

Uses a Twitch chat bot to read messages from Twitch chat and displays them inside of the Stardew Valley chat.
You will need an OAuth token, which you can create here: https://twitchapps.com/tmi/

The idea for this mod comes from [RyanGoods](https://github.com/StardewModders/mod-ideas/issues/1047).

Code for Twitch bot comes from [this article](https://medium.com/swlh/writing-a-twitch-bot-from-scratch-in-c-f59d9fed10f3),
I seriously couldn't have made this mod without it.
